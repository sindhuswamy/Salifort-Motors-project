# Salifort-Motors-project

**Business problem**

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee retention.
The goal of this project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
If we can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

**Approach**

Used Logistic regression and tree based models such as decision tree and randon forest to predict whether an employee would leave the company or not and compared their accuracies.
